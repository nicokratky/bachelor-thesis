Over the last years and decades cloud computing emerged as a paradigm which allows customers to receive compute power in a pay-as-you-go and on-demand manner.

This chapter introduces some terminology and concepts that are used throughout this thesis. First the cloud computing concepts are defined and then the used framework is introduced.

\section{Elasticity in Cloud Computing}

Elasticity is one of the core concepts that solves a big problem of cloud computing: providing limited resources for potentially unlimited use. The solution is to scale workloads up and down as needed, to claim resources when bigger load is experienced and release resources when they are not needed, therefore making them available to other workloads.

The term elasticity in computing is conceptually similiar to the term in physics. Wikipedia, for example, defines elasticity as follows: ``In physics and materials science, elasticity is the ability of a body to resist a distorting influence and to return to its original size and shape when that influence or force is removed. Solid objects will deform when adequate loads are applied to them; if the material is elastic, the object will return to its initial shape and size after removal.''\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)}}

The formula - which takes a more mathematical approach - of elasticity can be defined as \[ e(Y, X) = \diff{Y}{X} \frac{X}{Y}, \] where \(e(Y, X)\) is the elasticity of \(Y\) with respect to \(X\) \cite{dustdarPrinciplesElasticProcesses2011}.

To illustrate this imagine an application that serves some content to its customers. These customers typically interact with the application during the day. This means that the application experiences significantly less load during the night. Once people wake up in the morning the load rises until it peaks in the afternoon. Then the load falls again when people go to sleep in the evening. Using this example it can be seen in \cref{fig:elasticity-application-no-scaling} that during the night the resources of the application are overprovisioned and during the day the resoures are underprovisioned.

If the concept of elasticity is applied to this example, resources can be released during the night (so called \textit{scale-in}) and more resources can be claimed as they are needed during the day (so called \textit{scale-out}). This is illustrated in \cref{fig:elasticity-application-scaling}.

Elasticity has multiple properties which are interdependent: resource elasticity, cost elasticity and quality elasticity \cite{dustdarPrinciplesElasticProcesses2011}. These properties are discussed in the following sections.

\subsection{Resource Elasticity}

The resource dimension of elasticity is mistakenly often used synonymously with elasticity. Meanwhile, resource elasticity is defined as the degree to which a system is able to adapt to workload changes by claiming and releasing resources autonomously, such that the resource supply matches the current demand as closely as possible \cite{herbstElasticityCloudComputing2013}. Another way to think of this is ``on the fly'' adaptions to load variations \cite{al-dhuraibiElasticityCloudComputing2018}.

What makes this definition easily mistaken, is that it solely considers the aquired resources and not the consequently incurred costs or changing quality.

\subsection{Cost Elasticity}

Cost elasticity uses cost as its main factor for elasticity decisions. One of the most popular models that build upon cost elasticity is \textit{utility computing}, also known as the \textit{pay-as-you-go} pricing model.

Amazon Web Services uses this elasticity dimension in their EC2 Spot Instance\footnote{\url{https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/}}. AWS provides its unused compute capacity at a large discount to its customers. But because these capacities are volatile, the prices are not fixed but are provided through a bidding process. The potential customer tells AWS their maximum price they are willing to pay. The customer can then run their instances as long as their bidding price is smaller than AWS's Spot Instance price.

\subsection{Quality Elasticity}

Similiar to the already discussed dimensions, quality elasticity is defined as letting software services adapt their mode of operastion to current operating conditions by providing results of varying output quality \cite{larssonQualityElasticityImprovedResource2019}. This means that when resource supply is low, the output quality also may be low. Likewise, if resource supply is sufficient, the output quality will also be high.
