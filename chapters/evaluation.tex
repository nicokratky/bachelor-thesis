\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:evaluation}

This chapter first introduces the setup that was used for evaluating the different elasticity strategies. Then the results of different tests are presented and discussed.

\section{Testsetup}
\label{sec:testsetup}

In order to test the different elasticity strategies a test environment has to be set up. It was decided to create three virtual machines (VM) that will form a Kubernetes cluster. Because of its easy of use microk8s was chosen as distribution\footnote{\url{https://microk8s.io/}}. All three virtual machines were assigned 10 vCPUs and 10GB of memory. One VM acts as the Kubernetes control plane while the other two join the cluster as worker nodes.

Everything that was deployed into the Kubernetes cluster was built using the infrastructure as code (IaC) tool HashiCorp Terraform\footnote{\url{https://www.terraform.io/}}. This enables rapid changes and reproducibility. Deployed resources include the kube-prometheus-stack\footnote{\raggedright\url{https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack}} for monitoring, the k8ssandra-operator\footnote{\url{https://docs.k8ssandra.io/components/k8ssandra-operator/}} for managing k8ssandra clusters and a definition for a k8ssandra cluster. Additionally, the in \cref{sec:metrics} mentioned Grafana ashboards are also deployed using Terraform.

\Cref{lst:k8c} illustrates a minimal definition of a 3 node k8ssandra cluster. Each node has resource limits of 800 millicpu and 6000 megabytes of memory and 3 gibibytes storage space.

\section{Benchmarks}

In the following sections, different test scenarios will be discussed. To let k8ssandra experience load, the built-in stress testing tool \texttt{cassandra-stress} was used\footnote{\raggedright\url{https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/stable/cassandra/tools/cassandra_stress.html}}.

\subsection{Stress Testing}

To set a baseline, three different k8ssandra cluster setups have been stress tested using \texttt{cassandra-stress}. The amount of write requests that the tool will make is set to be 1000000, the exact call is listed in \cref{lst:stress-1000000writes}. These cluster setups merely differ in the cluster size, thus the amount of nodes. All clusters were provisioned with limits of 2 CPUs and 6GB of memory.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={},
                    captionpos=b,
                    label=lst:stress-1000000writes,
                    float]
./cassandra-stress write n=1000000 -mode native cql3 \
    user='USERNAME' password='PASSWORD'
\end{lstlisting}

The results of these tests are depicted in \cref{fig:stress-1000000writes-1node,fig:stress-1000000writes-2node,,fig:stress-1000000writes-3node}. The write throughput increases with the amount of nodes, but not linearly. This, however, was to be expected as \texttt{cassandra-stress} does not partition data in way that favours linear scalability. The average write throughputs of these different clusters can be seen in \cref{tab:stress-1000000writes-ops}.
