  abstract = {Cloud computing represents a novel on-demand computing approach where resources are provided in compliance to a set of predefined non-functional properties specified and negotiated by means of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In order to avoid costly SLA violations and to timely react to failures and environmental changes, advanced SLA enactment strategies are necessary, which include appropriate resource-monitoring concepts. Currently, Cloud providers tend to adopt existing monitoring tools, as for example those from Grid environments. However, those tools are usually restricted to locality and homogeneity of monitored objects, are not scalable, and do not support mapping of low-level resource metrics e.g., system up and down time to high-level application specific SLA parameters e.g., system availability. In this paper we present a novel framework for managing the mappings of the Low-level resource Metrics to High-level SLAs (LoM2HiS framework). The LoM2HiS framework is embedded into FoSII infrastructure, which facilitates autonomic SLA management and enforcement. Thus, the LoM2HiS framework detects future SLA violation threats and can notify the enactor component to act so as to avert the threats. We discuss the conceptual model of the LoM2HiS framework, followed by the implementation details. Finally, we present the first experimental results and a proof of concept of the LoM2HiS framework.},

  abstract = {We describe a novel framework for specifying and monitoring Service Level Agreements (SLA) for Web Services. SLA monitoring and enforcement become increasingly important in a Web Service environment where enterprise applications and services rely on services that may be subscribed dynamically and on-demand. For economic and practical reasons, we want an automated provisioning process for both the service itself as well as the SLA managment system that measures and monitors the QoS parameters, checks the agreed-upon service levels, and reports violations to the authorized parties involved in the SLA management process. Our approach to these issues is presented in this paper. The Web Service Level Agreement (WSLA) framework is targeted at defining and monitoring SLAs for Web Services. Although WSLA has been designed for a Web Services environment, it is applicable as well to any inter-domain management scenario, such as business process and service management, or the management of networks, systems and applications in general. The WSLA framework consists of a flexible and extensible language based on XML Schema and a runtime architecture comprising several SLA monitoring services, which may be outsourced to third parties to ensure a maximum of objectivity. WSLA enables service customers and providers to unambiguously define a wide variety of SLAs, specify the SLA parameters and the way they are measured, and relate them to managed resource instrumentations. Upon receipt of an SLA specification, the WSLA monitoring services are automatically configured to enforce the SLA. An implementation of the WSLA framework, termed SLA Compliance Monitor, is publicly available as part of the IBM Web Services Toolkit.},

To address these problems, we introduce our notion of quality-elasticity as a manner of dynamically adapting response qualities from software services along a fine-grained spectrum. When resources are abundant, response quality can be increased, and when resources are scarce, responses are delivered at a lower quality to prioritize throughput and response times. We present an example of how a complex online shopping site can be made quality-elastic. Experiments show that, compared to state of the art, improvements in throughput (57\% more served queries), lowered response times (8 time reduction for 95th percentile responses), and an estimated 40\% profitability increase can be made using our quality-elastic approach. When resources are abundant, our approach may achieve upwards of twice as high resource utilization as prior work in this field.},

However, stakeholders have little guidance for choosing fitting definitions and metrics for these quality properties, thus leading to potential misunderstandings. For example, cloud consumers and providers cannot negotiate reliable and quantitative service level objectives directly understood by each stakeholder. Objectives: Therefore, we examine existing definitions and metrics for these quality properties from the viewpoint of cloud consumers, cloud providers, and software architects with regard to commonly used concepts. Methods: We execute a systematic literature review (SLR), reproducibly collecting common concepts in definitions and metrics for scalability, elasticity, and efficiency. As quality selection criteria, we assess whether existing literature differentiates the three properties, exemplifies metrics, and considers typical cloud characteristics and cloud roles. Results: Our SLR yields 418 initial results from which we select 20 for in-depth evaluation based on our quality selection criteria. In our evaluation, we recommend concepts, definitions, and metrics for each property. Conclusions: Software architects can use our recommendations to analyze the quality of cloud computing applications. Cloud providers and cloud consumers can specify service level objectives based on our metric suggestions.},

Unfortunately, there is only limited support to clearly map workload performance requirements to the resource capacity guarantees.

The implementation of such metrics and SLOs, the triggering of elasticity strategies, and allowing configurability by the user deploying an application, requires a flexible middleware. In this paper, we present a middleware that provides an orchestrator-independent SLO controller for periodically evaluating SLOs and triggering elasticity strategies, while decoupling SLOs from the elasticity strategies to increase flexibility, and provider-independent services for obtaining low-level metrics and composing them into higher-level metrics. We evaluate our middleware by implementing a motivating use case, featuring a cost efficiency SLO for an application deployed on Kubernetes.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing promises customers the on-demand ability to dynamically provision virtualization resources in face of workload variations. Most existing scaling approaches addressed this problem by allocating application to a certain amount of cloud resources. However, the problem of the availability of application influenced by VM-based physical locations during resource scaling process is a serious challenge due to dynamic complex workload and has not been widely discussed yet. In this paper, we present a novel availability-based computing model to describe availability attribute of one application in the hierarchical structured cloud. Moreover, we propose an availability-aware policy by performing both vertical and horizontal scaling to explore how and where to allocate computing resource. Simulation results indicate that our model captured the availability of cloud applications properly and proposed scaling approach achieves the objectives of meeting availability demands and minimizing the total communication cost.},
